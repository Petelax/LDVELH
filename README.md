# Livre dont vous êtes le héros
Choose your own adventure C# program for school.

This is only an example program. 

How to run:
1. Click the green clone button and click "Download ZIP".
2. Once downloaded, unzip the folder.
3. Go to LDVELH-master/LDVELH-master/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/publish on you're drive.
4. Run LDVELH.exe.
5. Ignore any anti-virus telling you to not run the program and run anyway.

Oh, by the way I have no idea how Macs work, so you'd probably need to figure out how to run an .exe which is designed for Windows 10 on MacOS.
